# MAX6958Breakout
An Arduino library to provide functions for working with my MAX6958 Breakout board.

For clarity, unless you're using the same board layout that I am, this library isn't going to be much use to you.
I've assigned numbers 1 through 36 to the LED channels on the MAX6958 and provided functions so you can turn them on and off without buggering about with register addresses.

That mapping won't necessarily be the same for you, in fact given that I made a mistake on the board, it won't even be the same for me by the next revision, so this is probably only of use to fewer than ten people on Earth :D
